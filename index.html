        </b>(born<i> October 2, 1869, Porbandar</i>, India—died
        <cite> January 30, 1948, Delhi</cite>) was an Indian lawyer, politician, social activist,<br /> and writer who
        became
        the leader
        of the Indian Independence Movement against British rule. As such, he came to be considered the father of
        his country. <br />Gandhi is internationally esteemed for his doctrine of nonviolent protest (satyagraha) to
        achieve political and social progress.
        In the eyes of millions of his<br /> fellow Indians, Gandhi was the Mahatma (“Great Soul”). The unthinking
        adoration of the huge crowds that gathered to see him all along the route of his tours<br /> made them a severe
        ordeal; he could hardly work during the day or rest at night. “The woes of the Mahatmas,” he wrote, “are
        known only to the Mahatmas.” <br />His fame spread worldwide during his lifetime and only increased after his
        death. The name Mahatma Gandhi is now one of the most universally recognized on earth.<br />In South Africa
        When 19, he came to London, qualified as a barrister (being "called" at the Inner Temple), and, returning to
        Bombay in 1892, set up a practice.<br />
        In 1896 he went to the Transvaal to help a client in a legal suit. That visit changed the whole course of his
        life. Seeing the social and political disabilities of his <br />fellow-countrymen in South Africa, he decided to
        stay
        and help them and soon he had become their political leader and adviser. Meanwhile a religious conflict was
        taking place<br />in within him. He read Tolstoy and corresponded with him: the result was an experiment in the
        simple communal life conducted by a small band of enthusiasts whom he had gathered together.<br /> He became an
        ascetic of the most rigorous type, setting great store by fasting and every form of self-denial. To the end of
        his life he remained a devout Hindu, but declared if ever "untouchability" <br />were made part of Hinduism he
        would
        cease to be a Hindu. Perhaps the greatest religious effort of his life was to break down "untouchability."
